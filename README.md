## Design

### Wireframes 

Basic wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using Balsamiq.

### Colors

The company does not have an official logo. A dark blue/grey was used as a starting point for the coolers color generator (based on an old business card that was used previously), which came up with a pallet consisting of earthy tones. Blue represents loyalty, reliability and confidence, and the earthy tones signify nature; customers often visit places of natural beauty when using their caravans for holidays or short breaks. 
The color palette was created using [Coolors](https://www.coolors.co/). 

![Color palette showing 5 different muted earthy tones; blue/grey, green, reds and stoney colors](assets/readme-images/color-palette.png)

### Typography

Google fonts was used to select the typography used within the website. BenchNine was primarly used across the site, with Oswald for logo and navigation bar, and sans-serif as fall back.

### Images

Most images used within the website were photographed and edited by myself, however I did use images of company logos from outside sources to link registered profile (credited below), as well as icons from FontAwesome.

### Accessibility

I have attempted to make the website as accessible as possible by using colors that contrast well, using semantic HTML and using descriptive alt attributes on images.
I have provided descriptions where icons are used to allow screen readers to read these.

### Structure

#### Homepage 

The homepage was designed to give ease of access to key information to prevent users having to search the website for what they need, providing a good user experience. The homepage therefore shows a list of services provided with a link to more information, which can be found within the prices page.

#### Prices

The prices page shows the set prices of certain service and maintenance options. The prices page also shows a call out cost and explains that quotes can be given for repair work as these do not generally have a set cost.

#### Contact 

The contact page has key information showing how to contat Cherwel Caravan Services, as well as a form they can fill out within the website if they would prefer not to call or use an external email system. The contact page also shows recent reviews from customers below contact information so any potential new customers who were looking to contact the service, can see what other customers think.

#### Common problems

This page was placed after the contact page, as users are able to call the engineer to talk them through any issues they may be able to fix themselves, but the option to use a written walkthrough was still important to add to the website.

#### Gallery

This page shows some images of recent work being carried out.
